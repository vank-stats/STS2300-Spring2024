We will use the following R packages during today's activity.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(Lock5Data)
library(moderndive)
library(patchwork)
```

In Notes 8, we used a data set of party affiliation in the House of Representatives to explore the idea of bootstrap distributions (and how those compared to things like sampling distributions, distributions for a sample, and distributions for a population). In that example, our population (and sample) consisted of categorical data and our sampling and bootstrap distributions were for sample proportions. In this activity, let's look at a similar example where we start with quantitative data.

**Note: The variable you are working with in this activity includes some missing values. When using the `mean()` and `sd()` functions, you will need to add the `na.rm = TRUE` argument to remove NA values from the calculations.**

1. Let's use the `AllCountries` data set from the `Lock5Data` package. This will be our population since it includes data from all countries of the world. Make a histogram of the `Rural` variable. Consider setting `binwidth` to a reasonable value and setting `boundary` to 0. Give your graph a title that indicates this is the distribution of our population. Lastly, calculate the population mean $\mu$ and population standard deviation $\sigma$.

```{r}

```

**Pop mean =**

**Pop SD =**

<br>


2. Now let's take a random sample of 50 countries from the population. You can use the `rep_sample_n()` function from the `moderndive` package to do this. Store your sample in an object called `mysample`. Then create a histogram of the `Rural` variable in your sample. Use the same `binwidth` and `boundary` arguments as your graph of your population. Give this one a title indicating it is the distribution of your sample (Note: Remember that we want to use the `set.seed()` function before we use randomness in our code.) Lastly, calculate teh sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample standard deviation $s$.

```{r}

```

**Sample mean =**

**Sample SD =**

<br>


3. What is similar and what is different between your two distributions thus far?

**Answer:**

<br>


4. Now let's approximate the sampling distribution for the sample mean by taking 1,000 random samples of size 50 from `AllCountries`. Then you will need to calculate the sample mean `Rural` value for each sample. Remember that you can do this using the `summarize()` function from the `dplyr` package. Store your result in an object called `sampling_dist`. 

```{r}

```

<br>


5. Create a histogram of your sampling distribution. Give it a title that indicates this is your sampling distribution. Does it make sense to use the same `bin_width` as before? Why or why not?

```{r}

```

**Answer:**

<br>


6. How does your sampling distribution compare to the two previous distributions? Why does it differ from those more than they differ from one another?

**Answer:**

<br>


7. For our last distribution, we are going to make a bootstrap distribution from our sample we took in question 2 (object called `mysample`). Use the `rep_sample_n()` function to take 1,000 samples of size 50 from your original sample. Remember that we will need to take these samples **with replacement**, so you'll need to change the corresponding argument to do that. Calculate the sample mean `Rural` value for each of your bootstrap resamples and store them in an object called `boot_dist`.

```{r}

```

<br>


8. Create a histogram of your bootstrap distribution. Give it a title that indicates this is your bootstrap distribution. What is similar and different between your bootstrap and sampling distributions?

```{r}

```

**Answer:**

<br>


9. Lastly, use the `patchwork` package to put these four graphs into a grid. Then briefly explain (i) what each graph shows, (ii) what value (population mean or sample mean) should be at/near the center of each graph, and (iii) whether their spread is closer to the population standard deviation of 24 or $\frac{24}{\sqrt{50}} = 3.4$.

```{r}

```

**Distribution of the population:**

**Distribution of the sample:**

**Sampling distribution:**

**Bootstrap resampling distribution:**
