# COVID-19 Antibodies Example

The example for this activity comes from a [2020 New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/health/coronavirus-fishing-boat.html) about a ship that had a coronavirus outbreak while at sea. This was before COVID-19 vaccines had been developed and at a time when people were still learning basic information about the virus. Before setting sail, the crew had been tested for COVID-19 antibodies and 3 of the 120 sailors had these antibodies while the other 117 did not. Below is a quote from the article.

> The three sailors confirmed to have neutralizing antibodies did not test positive for the virus during the course of the study; 103 of the remaining 117 became infected. "These numbers may be small, but theyâ€™re highly significant", Dr. Greninger said.

We will conduct a hypothesis test to see if we can see what Dr. Greninger means when he says these results are "highly significant".

<br>


1. Step 1 - How could we set up our hypotheses based on our likely question of interest? Try doing this both in symbols and in words.

**In symbols...** 

$H_0$:

$H_a$:

**Parameter definitions:**


**In words...**

$H_0$:

$H_a$:

<br>


2. Step 2 - The data is mentioned at the top of this activity. I've included code to read it into R below. Create a graph displaying the data in relation to our question of interest and calculate an appropriate statistic for this question.

```{r}
ship <- data.frame(antibodies = c(rep("yes", 3), rep("no", 117)),
                   infected = c(rep("no", 17), rep("yes", 103)))
```

**Statistic:**

<br>


3. Step 3 - Create a null distribution and visualize it with a p-value shaded in. Then calculate the p-value and write a sentence about what the p-value means in context of this example.

```{r}

```

**p-value = **

**Sentence: **

<br>


4. Step 4 - Write a formal conclusion for this example.

**Conclusion:**

<br>


5. Were the results "highly significant"? In other words, are we still able to learn something about the role of antibodies despite only having three people in the group that had them?

**Answer:**

<br>


6. Besides the sample size, are there any other reasons we may want to be cautious about attributing the whole difference we're seeing to whether the person had antibodies or not? (Hint: What other ways may these people have differed from the people without antibodies?)

**Answer:**

<br>

# Revisiting Fidget Spinners Example

We previously looked at some data where people used fidget spinners and researchers measured their attention and memory. Suppose we want to compare the attention score between people who are near a fidget spinner (but not the one using it) and people with no spinner present. We suspect that those without a spinner present might have a higher attention score. (Use $\alpha = 0.05$ for your significance level)

<br>

7. **Step 1** - Write out the appropriate hypotheses for this problem. Define any parameters below.

$H_0:$

$H_A:$

**Define parameter(s)**

<br>


8. **Step 2** - Below is code to read in the data and to remove the third group (those actively using a spinner). Generate a graph to view the data and then calculate an appropriate statistic to summarize the data for these hypotheses. Write a couple sentences about what you notice.

```{r}
fidget <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vank-stats/STS2300-Spring2024/main/data/fidget_spinners.csv") %>%
  filter(Condition != "Spinner")
```

**Statistic:**

**Description:**

<br>


9. **Step 3** - Use the `infer` package to generate a null distribution. Visualize your p-value on the distribution and calculate the p-value. Write a sentence explaining what the p-value means in context. (Note: You are not writing a conclusion for your hypothesis test yet.)

```{r}

```

**p-value =**

**Sentence:**

<br>


10. **Step 4** - Write a conclusion for your hypothesis test based on the p-value.

**Conclusion:**


<br>


11. Does this mean that fidget spinners aren't distracting for people nearby? If not, what does it mean?

**Answer:**


<br>


12. A 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means would be around (-0.2, 0.7). Discuss how this does or does not agree with your hypothesis test conclusion.

**Answer:**
