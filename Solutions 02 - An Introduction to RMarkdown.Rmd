```

This file is an R Markdown file (ending in .Rmd). Unlike a regular R script (ending in .R), we can mix text, code, and output in the same file. This means that we can run code in the same place where we discuss our results. There are even ways to make it so that our text automatically changes when we change our code. This could be useful for a company who wants a monthly report to update automatically with small changes to data/code.

The process of creating the document that combines text, code, and output is called "Knitting." Try hitting the dropdown arrow on the button above that says Knit. For now, let's choose "Knit to HTML".

<br>


1. Where does the knitted document show up?

**Answer:** A window pops up that includes the formatted document.

**Note:** You can change this by going to Tools --> Global Options --> R Markdown. Then change "Show output preview in" to Viewer.

<br>


2. R Markdown files also allow you to format some of your text. For example, what happens when I put words between *one* or **two** asterisks?

**Answer:** Put one asterisk on either side of a word to *italicize* it. Put two asterisks on either side to **bold** it.

<br>


3. Let's take a look at adding code to our document. Notice how the section below this question has a gray background. This is an R **code chunk**. We can type code in this section and R will run it sequentially as it knits our document. Write code for one of the numeric summaries from Notes 2 in this section. In the text section below the code, write what is displayed when you knit the document.

```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
min(mtcars$hp)
quantile(mtcars$wt, probs = 0.8)
sd(mtcars$disp)
```

**Answer:** The knitted document shows our code and the output from that code. The output starts with two hashtag symbols. The code has a greyer background while the output has a white background like our document.

<br>


4. Let's use the code chunk below to load the `dplyr` package. Notice that we get some messages along with our code. We probably wouldn't want these in a formal document. At the top of the code chunk there is `{r}`. We can change settings here to control what gets displayed and / or run along with this code chunk. Try changing it to read `{r, message = FALSE}`, then knitting the document again. What happens when we do that? (Note: Sometimes you will get a warning instead of a message. These can be controlled using `warning =`)

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

**Answer:** When we add message = FALSE in the curly brackets, the messages no longer show up in our knitted document.

<br>


5. Let's continue to explore ways to use .Rmd files. Write code in the code chunk below to display the first 5 observations from the `mtcars` data (Hint: We did this in Notes 1). After you add your code, hit the little green triangle on the right side of the code chunk. What happens?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
head(mtcars, n = 5)
```

**Answer:** It runs the code in that code chunk and displays any results/output in our .Rmd file below the code chunk. 

<br>


6. We already saw how we could use `message = FALSE` to remove messages when we run a code chunk. Try adding `echo = FALSE` in the same spot on your code chunk in the previous question, then knit the document and write down what it does. Next, replace that with `eval = FALSE`, then knit the document and write down what it does.

**Answer about echo:** If we use echo = FALSE we are telling R not to include our code in the knitted document.

**Answer about eval:** If we use eval = FALSE we are telling R to not show the output in the knitted document (which is achieved by not running the code).

<br>


7. You may have noticed that `<br>` keeps showing up in the document. What do think this is doing? If you aren't sure, try putting it on three or four lines in a row and knitting the file.

**Answer:** br stands for "break" and it adds a space in the document

<br>


8. Let's try an example to see how we might use R Markdown to generate reports that update automatically. Suppose I want to be able to summarize schools of different sizes each in their own document.

We are going to revisit the `MA_schools` data from the `moderndive` package. Below is some code to generate the mean and median average SAT scores for small schools. It creates an object called `school_size` and another called `school_summary`. (Note: The `%>%` symbol is something we will learn about in Notes 3. For now, don't worry about exactly what the code is doing.)

```{r}
library(moderndive)
school_size <- "large"

school_summary <- MA_schools %>%
  filter(size == school_size) %>%
  summarize(MeanSAT = mean(average_sat_math), 
            MedSAT = median(average_sat_math)) %>%
  round(digits = 0)
```

Now in my text, I can tell someone that the mean average SAT score of `r school_size` schools is `r school_summary$MeanSAT` and the median is `r school_summary$MedSAT`. 

These numbers will change if you just change the value I assign to `school_size` above. Try it out for medium and large schools. Knit the document after you make each change. How am I telling R to include values from R objects directly in the text section of my document?

**Answer:** We can run R code directly within our text section of our documents by typing two tick marks (just under Esc key) that have the letter r followed by our code inside of them. 

<br>


9. What should I do if I wanted to display my analysis but not my code for the example above?

**Answer:** As we saw above, we can use the echo = FALSE option for this.

<br>


10. It can be hard to memorize everything we can do with .RMD files. There are a collection of [RStudio cheatsheets at this link](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). These can be really useful documents. For example, the RMarkdown one helped me remember how to add a link to my document! Go to this link, find the RMarkdown cheatsheet, and pick a few of the features in the "Write With RMarkdown" section on the right of the page to experiment with below. Re-knit your document after to see if they worked!

Below are some of the many things you all tried out:

Text formatting: **Bold**, *italicize*, ~~strike through~~

Links: [Elon's website](www.elon.edu)

Lists:

* Top item
  - sub item 1
  - another sub item
* Back to my main items

Equations with superscripts and subscripts: $x_1 + x_2 = y^2$ or $e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0$

# Large header

## Slightly smaller header

### Even smaller header

> Text blocks. This is nice for something you want to stand out

11. You may have noticed that when we print data frames, it doesn't always look that great in the knitted file. One option is to use the `kableExtra` package. You can find examples of new table formats [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html). I've loaded the `kableExtra` package and used the classic theme below. Try printing the same table using one or two of the other themes from the link above. You may also want to try out some of the options within the theme function(s) you choose.

**Note**: I set this chunk to `eval = FALSE` so the document would knit even if you didn't have `kableExtra` installed. Once you install the package, you can remove that argument.

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

kbl(head(mtcars, 5)) %>%
  kable_classic()
```

<br>


12. Can you figure out how to make it so that your table doesn't take up the full width of the screen and so that it alternates shading between rows?

```{r}
kbl(head(mtcars, 5)) %>%
  kable_paper("striped", full_width = F)
```

**Note:** You could use any of the `kable_xxxx()` functions along with these arguments to answer this question.

<br>


13. Lastly, if you have Microsoft Word, you can Knit to Word to create a Word document. This is what I have been doing for the notes and activities in our class! Sometimes the formatting gets messed up a little, but you can then change it in Word if you need to. You can also Knit documents to pdf (what I prefer for a nice looking and easy to share file), but it requires you to have a separate program installed. See [here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) for more info if you're interested (or talk to me if you'd like help getting pdf knitting set up).

# Optional Section

13. Another option to make nice tables is the `tabyl` function from the `janitor` package. Below are a couple of examples. You can see more [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html).

**Note**: I set this chunk to `eval = FALSE` so the document would knit. Once you install `janitor`, you can remove that argument.

```{r}
library(janitor)

# One variable - produces count and percent
tabyl(mtcars, am)

# One variable with total added and percents reformatted
tabyl(mtcars, am) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting()

# Two variables - produces count
tabyl(mtcars, am, cyl)

# Two variables with percentages, counts in parentheses
tabyl(mtcars, am, cyl) %>%
  adorn_percentages("all") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  adorn_ns()
```

Try re-creating one or two of the tables you've previously made with some of the formatting options above. (Note: You could also use `kableExtra` functions on these tables when you are done.)

```{r}
tabyl(mtcars, cyl) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_classic_2("striped", full_width = F)
```
