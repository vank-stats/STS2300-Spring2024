# Scraping Data with `rvest`

Before we get started, you'll need to install the `rvest` package, which includes functions to let us scrape data from websites.

In addition to reading in .csv, Excel, and other data files, you may find yourself wanting to extract data from the web. [Section 6.4.4.2 of Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/06-dataII.html#sec-htmltab) includes example code to do this (particularly for Wikipedia pages). If you're interested in the topic, you can find **much** more detailed information in [Chapter 25 of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping).

1. The Hugo Award is given each year for the best science fiction or fantasy novel. You can see the Wikipedia page for the award [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel). The code below takes the URL, reads the html code for the page, and extracts all the tables it finds. This is stored in an object called hugo_noms. Run the code below and then use the console to see what the `hugo_noms` object looks like.

```{r}
hugo_award <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel" %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes("table")
```

**Notes about object created:** This is creating a list type object (which we won't really talk about in this class). Lists contain multiple other object types. For our purposes, we just want to be able to grab data frames from this object.

<br>


2. The code below will give us the *first* table on the Wikipedia page. Add code to display the first several rows of the data. Is this what we want? If not, how could we change the code to get the large table of winners and nominees? Change the code below and answer below what you did.

```{r}
hugo_noms <- hugo_award %>%
  purrr::pluck(2) %>%
  html_table()
```

**Answer:** The first table (when we tried pluck(1)), was not the table we wanted. When we changed 1 to 2, we got the correct table. For future problems, you can use a guess and check approach like this.

<br>


3. Look up the help file for the `rename()` function from the `dplyr` package. Use the function to rename the `Author(s)` column to just Author so that we get rid of the parentheses in the name. (Note: When referencing a column with special characters or spaces in it, you need to put tick marks around the name. This is the same symbol we used for in-line R code in Activity 2, and it is found below the Esc key.)

```{r}
hugo_noms <- rename(hugo_noms, Author = `Author(s)`)
```

<br>


4. Write code that will subset the data to keep only the Year, Author, and Novel columns in the `hugo_noms` object.

```{r}
hugo_noms <- select(hugo_noms, Year, Author, Novel)
```

<br>


5. The asterisk at the end of an author's name is used to tell us whether an author won the award that year. We can use the `str_detect()` function from the `stringr` package to see if an asterisk is part of the name. Install the `stringr` package and add code at the top of the document to load the package. Then add code below that uses the `mutate()` function to create a new variable called `Winner` calculated as `str_detect(Author, "\\*")`. What does our new winner column look like? (Note: Because asterisks are a special character, we add `\\` in front of it in the code.)

```{r}
hugo_noms <- mutate(hugo_noms,
                    Winner = str_detect(Author, "\\*"))
```

**Answer:** The column is called Winner and says TRUE whenever the author name had an asterisk (i.e. when they won the award) and FALSE whenever it did not.

<br>


6. Now that we have a column of winners, it would be nice to remove the asterisk so that the Author column only includes names. We can use `str_remove()` to do this. 

```{r}
hugo_noms <- mutate(hugo_noms,
                    Author = str_remove(Author, "\\*"))
```


6. Create a new object called `hugo_winners` that only includes the books that won the award.

```{r}
hugo_winners <- hugo_noms %>%
  filter(Winner)
```

<br>


7. Create a new object called `hugo_authors` that calculates the number of nominations (including wins) and number of wins for each author. Then sort the data in descending order by number of nominations. Which author has been nominated the most for this award? Which author was nominated the most without ever winning? (Hint: In R, values of TRUE count as a 1 and values of FALSE count as a 0 in numeric calculations. To find the number of wins, use the `sum()` function.)

```{r}
hugo_authors <- hugo_noms %>%
  summarize(Nominations = n(),
            Wins = sum(Winner),
            .by = Author) %>%
  arrange(desc(Nominations))
head(hugo_authors, n = 10)
```

**Most nominations:** Robert A. Heinlein and Lois McMaster Bujold

**Most nominations without winning:** Robert Silverberg

<br>


8. We ended up repeating code a lot (especially data frame names) because we did this step by step. See if you can use the pipe operator to do all of the following at once:

  - Extract the correct table from the `hugo_award` object
  - Rename the `Author(s)` variable to Author
  - Subset the data to only include Year, Author, and Novel
  - Create a Winner variable using `str_detect()`
  - Remove asterisks from Author names using `str_remove()`
  - Calculate the number of nominations and number of wins for each author
  - Sort the list in descending order by number of nominations
  
```{r}
hugo_summary <- hugo_award %>%
  purrr::pluck(2) %>%
  html_table() %>%
  rename(Author = `Author(s)`) %>%
  select(Year, Author, Novel) %>%
  mutate(Winner = str_detect(Author, "\\*"),
         Author = str_remove(Author, "\\*")) %>%
  summarize(Nominations = n(),
            Wins = sum(Winner),
            .by = Author) %>%
  arrange(desc(Nominations))

head(hugo_summary, n = 10)
```

9. (Bonus) The [Nebula Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award_for_Best_Novel) is another award for best science fiction / fantasy novel. The Wikipedia page is set up very similarly. Take your code from the previous question, replace the URL, and see if you can get a table of authors who have been nominated for the Nebula Award. (Note: Notice that the author column is already called Author on this page, so you won't need to rename it.)

```{r}
nebula_award <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award_for_Best_Novel" %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes("table")

nebula_summary <- nebula_award %>%
  purrr::pluck(2) %>%
  html_table() %>%
  select(Year, Author, Novel) %>%
  mutate(Winner = str_detect(Author, "\\*"),
         Author = str_remove(Author, "\\*")) %>%
  summarize(Nominations = n(),
            Wins = sum(Winner),
            .by = Author) %>%
  arrange(desc(Nominations))

head(nebula_summary, n = 10)
```
