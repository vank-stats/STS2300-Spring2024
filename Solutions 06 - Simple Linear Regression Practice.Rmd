We will use the following R packages during today's activity.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(Lock5Data)
```

---

For this activity, we'll use a dataset called `RestaurantTips` from the `Lock5Data` R package. The data was collected by the owner of a bistro in New York and contains 157 bills at the restaurant over a two week period. Let's explore the relationship between the size of the bill, called `Bill`, and the size of the tip, called `Tip`. Both variables are measured in dollars.

I'm going to read the data into R and call it `tips` to shorten the name a bit.

```{r}
tips <- RestaurantTips
```


1. Suppose we want to create a scatterplot comparing the size of the bill and the tip size. Which variable should be the explanatory variable and which should be the response variable? Why?

**Answer:** We will use the size of the bill (explanatory variable) to help us predict / explain the tip size (response variable). People use the bill size (which comes first) to determine their tip (which comes second).

<br>


2. Make a scatterplot comparing the bill size and the tip size. (Bonus: Consider adding a theme and making the labels nicer with `labs()`)

```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x = Bill, y = Tip)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  labs(title = "Comparing Bill Size and Tip Amount at a NY Bistro",
       x = "Bill amount",
       y = "Tip size",
       caption = "Data from Lock5Data R package")
```

<br>


3. What do you notice about the relationship between the two variables?

**Answer:** Tip size tends to go up as the bill goes up. However, there are a few values further away from most of the others (usually above them). The relationship follows a straight line pattern pretty well.

<br>


4. Let's use R to calculate a simple linear regression line for this data. Write the formula for the line after you run your R code. I've used R Markdown's math mode to show you how you can write the general formula. You will just need to replace $b_0$ and $b_1$ with the numbers from your equation. You could also replace y and x with the variable names if you'd like.

```{r}
tips.lm <- lm(Tip ~ Bill, data = tips)
tips.lm
```

**Formula:** $\widehat{Tip} = -0.2923 + 0.1822 * Bill$

<br>


5. Suppose you're a server at the restaurant and someone has just spent \$23.70 on a meal. How much would you predict their tip would be?

```{r}
# Option 1
 -0.2923 + 0.1822 * 23.7

# Option 2
predict(tips.lm, newdata = data.frame(Bill = 23.7))
```

**Prediction =** \$4.03

<br>


6. There was one person in the dataset who actually did have a bill of \$23.70. They left a \$10 tip. What would be the residual for that observation?

```{r}
10 - 4.03
```

**Residual =** \$5.97

<br>


7. Would it be a good idea to use this data to predict the tip size for a \$200 bill at this restaurant? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Not necessarily. The biggest value in our data set was a bill of \$70.51. It's possible that tipping habits differ when the bill becomes that large.

<br>


8. Would it be a good idea to use this data to predict the tip size for a \$20 bill at The Root here in Elon? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Possibly. While this data was from a bistro in NY, there are generally accepted tipping practices that might apply here are The Root too.

<br>


9. You can  add a simple linear regression line to your scatterplot by adding `geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)` as another layer to your ggplot object. Try this out below. Can you find the observation whose residual we just calculated on the graph? (Note: You will need to respecify your x and y aesthetics in `geom_smooth()` or move them to the `ggplot()` function instead.)

```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x = Bill, y = Tip)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  labs(title = "Comparing Bill Size and Tip Amount at a NY Bistro",
       x = "Bill amount",
       y = "Tip size",
       caption = "Data from Lock5Data R package")
```

<br>


10. Interpret the estimated y-intercept in context of this problem. Is this an extrapolation or an interpolation?

**Interpretation of y-intercept:** The predicted tip is -\$0.29 for a bill of \$0.00 at this bistro. 

**Extrapolation or interpolation?:** This is an extrapolation (we can't have a bill size of \$0), and the result is clearly impossible.

<br>


11. Interpret the estimated slope in context of this problem.

**Interpretation of slope:** The predicted tip goes up by \$0.18 for every additional dollar spent on the bill (at this bistro in New York).

<br>


12. Does your estimated slope make sense based on what you know about tipping?

**Answer:**  Yes! Standard tipping practices are generally to tip 15-20%, and this is in line with that. 

<br>


13. Use the `summary()` function on the object created by the `lm()` function. Find the R-squared value in the output and write a sentence interpreting it.

```{r}
summary(tips.lm)
```

**R-squared =** 0.8373

**Interpretation:** About 84% of the variability in tip size can be explained by bill size.

Bonus: Investigate how well the size of the bill can help predict the tip percentage (`PctTip`).

* Make a scatterplot. What is the relationship between the two variables? How does it compare to what we saw when we compared bill size to tip size (both in terms of dollars).


* Calculate a simple linear regression line and interpret the estimated intercept and estimated slope.
